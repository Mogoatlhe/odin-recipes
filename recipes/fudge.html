    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I double the recipe and put in a glass baking dish (9x13 inches). Nice for holidays . . . Keep it for a secret and family and friends will think you worked forever on it . . . (smiles). You can also use peanut butter chips and make peanut butter fudge.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, and butter or margarine in large microwaveable bowl. Zap in microwave on medium until chips are melted, about 3-5 minute, stirring once or twice during cooking. Stir in nuts, if desired.</li>
        <li>Pour into well-greased 8x8-inch glass baking dish. Refrigerate until set.</li>
    </ol>
